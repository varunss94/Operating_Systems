Project Details: This project shows multiprocessing in action. It involes creating multiple processes and each child process executing a diff erent program. The parent process waits for the child process to end, prints the PID of the ended process.

How to run the program? 
1. Open Linux terminal
2. Navigate to the location where the program and the related files are stored.
3. Enter Command ./program_multiprocessing *enter a number*  - Example ./program_multiprocessing 5 (Here 5 creates 5 child processes) 

Note: The program accepts command line arguments hence we need to enter the number of processes to be created at the command line as expalined in 3.
